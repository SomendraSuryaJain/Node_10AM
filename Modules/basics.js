// modules ==> it is a logical piece of code which can be reused multiple times.
// ==> using modules we can easily break our code into smaller and reusable parts
// ==> it increases code visibility and maintainability..
// ==> it helps us to avoid code duplication. (DRY principle ==> Don't Repeat Yourself)

//! in nodeJS we have three different types of modules ==> built in, user defined and third party modules.

//? user-defined modules ==> these modules are created by users. also known as local modules.

//? third-party modules ==> these modules are installed from a third party source (npm), to use it's functionality we have to install it first. example ==> express, mongodb, multer, dotenv, etc...

//? built-in modules ==> built in modules are pre-installed while installing nodeJS, i.e. core modules. core/built-in are examples of modules which are already present in nodeJS environment. examples ==> fs, path, http, os, crypto etc....
